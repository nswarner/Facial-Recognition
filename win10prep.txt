Setting up Windows 10 for Python, OpenCV, pip(comes bundled), numpy, and matplotlib(not yet used)

On Windows 10
	- Download and install Python 2.7*
		- https://www.python.org/downloads/
	- IF you do not have pip**
		- Download ez_setup.py
		- Download get-pip.py
		- [cli]python <path_to>ez_setup.py
		- [cli]python <path_to>get-pip.py
	- [cli]pip install numpy
	- [cli]pip install matplotlib
	- Download and install PIL
		- http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
	- Download cmake installer (exe), install
	- Download the openCV compressed executable (exe, version 2.4.x, not 3.x)
		- http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.4.6/OpenCV-2.4.6.0.exe/download
	- Extract openCV
	- Go to <path_to>/opencv/build/python/2.7/(x64|x86)/
		- Copy cv2.pyd to <path_to>/Python27/lib/site-packages
		- Mine was x86 and would not work with x64 (despite 64bit system)
	- Open Python IDLE and type in:
		- [idle]import cv2
		- [idle]print cv2.__version__

* IF you have Python 3.x installed: Settings --> System --> About --> System Info --> Advanced System Settings --> Environment Variables --> System variables --> [Select Path, click Edit] --> Delete or Move Down priority of Python3x and Python3x/Scripts below Python27 and Python27/Scripts --> Click OK
** Python 3.4.x and Python 2.7.x come with pip; to verify if you have pip, open a cmd window and type pip --version

Style Guide:
	[cli] means open a cmd window and execute this command on the command line
	(blah1|blah2) means choose either blah1 or blah2 based on your system preferences
	<path_to> means figure out where you have these items installed
	[idle] means open IDLE, the Python generic IDE, and type these commands
		Alternatively, open a cmd window, type python, then try the commands
